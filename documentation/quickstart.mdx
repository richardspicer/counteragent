title: Quickstart
description: Install CounterAgent and run your first MCP server security scan
---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- An MCP server to test (or use the example below)

## Install

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install counteragent
```

```bash uv (from source)
git clone https://github.com/q-uestionable-AI/counteragent.git
cd counteragent
uv sync --group dev
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
CounterAgent is not yet published to PyPI. Use the git clone method for now.
</Note>

## Run your first scan

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a target server">
    You can scan any MCP server you have permission to test. This guide uses the
    official MCP memory server as an example:

    ```bash
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the scan">
    ```bash
    counteragent audit scan \
      --transport stdio \
      --command "npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
    ```

    CounterAgent connects to the server, enumerates its tools and resources, then
    runs all 10 OWASP MCP Top 10 scanner modules against it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the output">
    The CLI prints a live summary as it runs:

    - **Connected** — confirms the transport and server name
    - **Scanners run** — lists each module that executed
    - **Findings** — any security issues found, with severity, description, and remediation
    - **Report saved** — path to the full JSON report (default: `results/scan.json`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enumerate a server

Before a full scan, you can quickly check what a server exposes:

```bash
counteragent audit enumerate \
  --transport stdio \
  --command "npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
```

This lists the server's tools, resources, and prompts without running any security checks.

## Check available scanners

```bash
counteragent audit list-checks
```

Prints a table of all scanner modules with their OWASP ID and status.
